# Getting started with Litepage

**Litepage is a lightweight library written in Go that simplifies building static sites**, for developers who want to build beautiful pages while keeping their stack simple and clean.

Declare the pages you want to create and Litepage will build or serve your static site, along with any assets in your `/public` folder.

You can use this library in conjunction with any static site hosting provider like:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)

## Features

Litepage gets out of your way and does just the **bare minimum every static site needs**. This means you can build your project your way, with your tools, and not tie your project to a specific framework.

- ⚡ Maintains zero dependencies
- 🪷 No framework lock-in
- 🎁 Builds your static site ready to be hosted on any static site provider
- ✨ Serves your static site locally during development
- 📍 Includes out of the box [sitemap.xml](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html)
- 📖 Common recipes to help with Markdown, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), live reloading and more
