# Getting started with Litepage

**Litepage is a lightweight library written in Go that simplifies building static sites**, for developers who want to build beautiful pages while keeping their stack simple and clean.

Litepage by design, **doesn't do much**. It provides a simple API to declare the pages you want to create and it will build or serve your static site, along with any assets in your `/public` folder.

You can use this library in conjunction with any static site hosting provider like:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)

## Features

Litepage gets out of your way and does just the **bare minimum every static site needs**. This means you can build your project your way, with your tools, and not tie your project to a specific framework.

- ⚡ Maintains zero dependencies
- 🪷 No framework lock-in
- 🎁 Builds your static site ready to be hosted on any static site provider
- ✨ Serves your static site locally during development
- 📍 Includes out of the box [sitemap.xml](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html)
- 📖 Common recipes to help with Markdown, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), live reloading and more
