# What is Litepage?

**Litepage is a lightweight library written in [Go](https://go.dev/) that simplifies building static sites**, for developers who want to build beautiful pages while keeping their stack simple and clean.

The aim is to make building static content sites as _**boring as possible**_, to have a project that can sit still for months or even years, and not become obsolete.

This is where Go really shines. With its built-in HTML templating, web server, and _[blazingly fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSY85SLXzwk)_ performance, we can go far leveraging the tools Go provides in its standard library, and only bring in specific dependencies when needed for the project you are trying to build.

## Features

Litepage by design, **doesn't do much**. It provides a simple API to declare the pages you want to create and it will build or serve your static site, along with any assets in your `/public` folder.

- ⚡ Maintains zero dependencies
- 🪷 No framework lock-in
- 🎁 Builds your static site ready to be hosted on any static site provider
- ✨ Serves your static site locally during development
- 📍 Includes out of the box [sitemap.xml](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html)

You can use this library in conjunction with any static site hosting provider like:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)
