# Who should use Litepage?

Litepage is for **developers** who want to explore creating static sites with **minimal dependencies** and **maximum control**.

## Frontend developers

Litepage is for frontend developers who may have only built sites with frontend frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), etc, who want to:

- learn Go as another language
- explore different paradigms when building sites
- take a break from the fast paced frontend ecosystem
- build something simple with low maintenance overhead
- build their own pages, and not be restricted to any libraries or templates

## Backend developers

Litepage is for backend developers who want to:

- Build their own layouts and pages with a language they already know
- Add a static site builder with minimal impact to a project
- Build beautiful pages, without using a JS framework
- Have fun learning HTML, CSS and JS, while working in a familiar language

And no matter what background you are coming from, Litepage is for **developers who want to build sites with a simple stack**.

## Who Litepage is not for

- For non-developers looking to create sites without coding
- For developers looking to leverage existing templates and layouts
- For developers looking for a feature rich, opinionated static site builders
